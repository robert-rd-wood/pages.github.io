<h3>Description</h3>
Study of traffic in the City of Chicago, including congestion, crash, and traffic camera data, all of which has been made publicly available by the City of Chicago.  

<h3>Data Sources</h3>

<ul>
<li>[data.cityofchicago.org](http://data.cityofchicago.org)</li>
<li>www.fhwa.dot.gov</li>
      

</ul>

<h3>Process</h3>
* Gather data from data.cityofchicago.org, via the Socrata Open Data API (SODA) or direct .csv download  
* Import and review data using Jupyter Notebook and Pandas  
* Evaluate scope of available data (reporting years, keys to link datasets)  
* Clean datasets  
* Remove NaN and ‘0’ values  
* Filter timeframe of data as needed to remove partial year reporting  
* Parse resulting data, link dataframes to determine answers to the questions posed  
* Visualize data using Matplotlib and Google Maps  
* Run statistical analysis to determine significance  

## Correlation Exploration
* Pair plot using available variables to visualize possible correlation  
* Possible correlation was observed between crash count and red light cameras, as well as crash count and speed cameras

## Questions and Conclusions
**1. In what areas are crashes more/less common?**

---

**2. Is there a correlation between crashes and red light cameras?  Crashes and speed cameras?**  

  ![alt text](output/Crashes_vs_Red_Light_Cams.png "Traffic Crashes vs. Red Light Cameras")

  There is a strong correlation between number of red light cameras and crashes  
  r = 0.80  
  p = 2.35e-07  

  ![alt text](output/Crashes_vs_Speed_Cams.png "Traffic Crashes vs. Speed Cameras")

  There is a strong correlation between number of speed cameras and crashes  
  r = 0.71  
  p = 1.43e-05  

  Note: Due to lack of available crash data prior to camera installation, not possible to prove causation or effect of camera installation on crash levels  

---

**3. What is the average congestion level hour by hour?  Does this correlate to the number of crashes?**  

  ![alt text](output/Crashes_and_Congestion_by_Hour.png "Average Crashes and Congestion by Hour")

  Trend shows higher congestion levels during standard morning and evening commutes, as expected.  There is an extremely strong correlation between congestion and crashes by time of day.  
  r = 0.95  
  p = 6.15e-13

**4. In what areas are drunk-driving accidents more/less common?**  

  ![alt text](output/BAC_bargraph.png "Car Crashes by Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)")

  ![alt text](output/Slide-Drunk_Crashes_by_Region_offset.png "Choropleth Map - Traffic Crashes Involving Drunk Drivers (BAC > .08)")

---

**5. What is the most common cause of crashes?  What age driver is most likely to be involved in a crash?**  

  ![alt text](output/primary_cause.png "Pareto - Primary Cause of Car Crash")

  ![alt text](output/AGE.png "Distribution - Age of Driver")

  The average age of a driver involved in a crash in Chicago is significantly lower than the average age of all drivers in Illinois.  
  p = 0.0023588  

---

**6. Is there a correlation between cameras and severity of accidents?**  

  ![alt text](output/InjuriesFatalitiesbyCameras.png "Injuries and Fatalitites Per Accident by Total Cameras in Region")

  There is poor correlation in both cases. (r for injuries is -.13, r for fatalities is -.25). Overall the rate of injuries is not dependent on the amount of traffic cameras present in a region.

**7. Is speeding a main contributor to crashes and in what areas are accidents involving speeding more/less common?**

## Possible Uses
* Public safety  
  * Identify regions with disproportionately low camera-to-crash ratio and install additional cameras accordingly  
* Insurance companies  
  * Identify risk of car crashes in a given region of the city  
* General public  
  * Identify regions with more frequent crashes  
* Law enforcement  
  * Increase DUI enforcement in regions with more crashes involving drunk drivers
